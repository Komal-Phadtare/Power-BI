## Problem Statement

This dashboard offers insights into YouTube subscribers segmented by channel category across various countries included in the dataset. The primary objective of this analysis is to identify patterns and trends within YouTube's engagement metrics, providing valuable guidance for content creators to make informed decisions.
 

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Most of the columns had nan values for country column having nan value it was converted to 'United States' after calculating the mode, and other columns with empty value were deleted.
- Step 5 : Later after the ETL process and data cleaning the charts were formed 

The key findings obtained from the analysis is below:

News channels tend to have the highest number of uploads, followed by entertainment and sports channels. However, despite the high volume of uploads, news channels have lower views per subscriber, which results in lower earnings. In contrast, entertainment channels enjoy higher views per subscriber, leading to higher earnings.

Additionally, countries with large populations, such as India and the U.S., are effectively targeted by content creators on respected channels, as evidenced by the high views per subscriber in these regions.

In summary, news channels should focus on strategies to increase their views. Similarly, sports content creators, who currently earn less but have high views per subscriber, should consider increasing their upload frequency to maximize earnings
